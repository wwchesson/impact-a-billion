# Will Chesson's Final Project - Flatiron School - Software Engineering

## Summary

<img src="./app.gif" alt="sampleLiveProject" height="700" >

impactABillion is a software solution for community building and service opportunities. It brokers requests from community members and people who are looking to make an impact on that community.

There are two types of users: "impacters" and "organizers." Impacters can make a service request, sign up for events, post about events, and collect carescapes. Carescapes are AI-generated art that an impacter receives after participating in an event.
Organizers can view impacters, approve or deny requests, and mark events as complete which generate a carescape for those impacters who participated in an event.

As a real-world application, I imagine impactABillion adapting its features to the specific needs of a particular town or city. For example, I imagine the app being launched as a city-wide initiative to promote environmental restoration, mentorships, meal sharing, donation organization, agroecology, life skills instruction, and more.
